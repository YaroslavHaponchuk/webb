			<p>Episode III</p>
			<h1>Revenge of the Markup</h1>
		</div>

		<p>When there is no more hope. When Winter is coming. When the White Walkers prepare to break down the Wall and JAVA can no longer stop them ... <br><br>
		Comes he - Javascript. Lord of untyped data and components, he does not give up technical tasks "to do nicely" and is not afraid of calculations on the user side. But he comes not alone, having 3 of his faithful friends with him: jQuery, React.js and Node.js.</p>

		<p>Yet in the background of every battle, a silent force supports them all — HTML. Ancient and unyielding, it forms the skeleton of every application, the canvas on which their powers unfold. <br><br>
		While JavaScript brings life, and CSS paints the colors, it is HTML that gives them meaning and structure. In this Episode, as chaos threatens the layout and components clash, HTML rises to reclaim its place.<br><br>
		For even the strongest scripts are nothing without a proper tag… and every element has its revenge.</p>
